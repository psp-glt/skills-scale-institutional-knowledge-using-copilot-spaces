## Communication Cadence
- **Daily**: Scrum Master-facilitated standups for delivery team
- **Weekly**: 
  - PM + PdM sync on priorities and roadmap

  - Tech Lead architecture and technical planning sessions
- **Bi-weekly**: UX Designer design reviews and user research presentations
- **Monthly**: Stakeholder updates via Stakeholder Proxy
- **Ad-hoc**: Escalations, blocker removal, and decision approvals as needed
- **Per Sprint/Release**: Retrospectives facilitated by Scrum Master, documentation updates by Documentation Specialist

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
