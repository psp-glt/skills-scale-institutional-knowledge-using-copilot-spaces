# Role Handoff Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures smooth transitions when project roles change hands (e.g., new PM, rotating Tech Lead, or temporary coverage). It helps maintain continuity, preserves context, and minimizes disruption to the team.

## When to Use
- Planned role transitions (e.g., new hire, promotion, rotation)
- Temporary coverage (e.g., vacation, leave of absence)
- Mid-project role changes
- Unexpected departures requiring emergency handoff

## Tips for Effective Handoffs
- **Start early**: Begin handoff process 2-4 weeks before transition if possible
- **Document everything**: Don't rely on verbal knowledge transfer alone
- **Prioritize**: Focus on critical information first, then nice-to-haves
- **Be available**: Outgoing person should remain accessible for questions
- **Shadow and overlap**: If possible, have overlap period where both work together
- **Check understanding**: Have incoming person teach back or demonstrate understanding
