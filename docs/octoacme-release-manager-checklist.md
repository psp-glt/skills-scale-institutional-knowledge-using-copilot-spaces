# Release Manager Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist ensures the Release Manager coordinates all aspects of production releases systematically, from planning through post-release validation. It provides a consistent framework for managing deployments across projects.

## How to Use
- Use this checklist for each planned release
- Customize timeline based on release size and risk
- Check off items as they're completed
- Flag blockers immediately to PM and stakeholders
- Document deviations and lessons learned
